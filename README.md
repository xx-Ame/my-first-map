## Why did I build this?

I decided to built this to show users where there are good trips you can take in those places well if provided by school,you can also visit those places.

## Tech stack

To build this app, I used the following tools:

1. I made a github account 
2. I used my tokens given by Mapbox to use in the HTML file.
3. I also used visual studio code.
4. I got some codes given by studio code and used those codes to get in the map
5. When I got in the map I placed the images and placed a desciption together with it.
